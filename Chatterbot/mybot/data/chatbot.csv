i cant sleep," Meditation is a technique that involves consciously directing one's attention to an object of focus (such as breathing or a sound or word) in order to increase awareness, relax the body, and calm the mind.Yoga -A system of relaxation, breathing, exercise, and healing with origins in Indian philosophy, yoga has been described as the union of mind, body, and spirit. What you eat and what you don't can have an effect on your ability to get to sleep and stay asleep. Limit your intake of caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine. Caffeine and nicotine can have a pronounced effect on sleep, causing insomnia and restlessness.17 In addition to coffee, tea, and soft drinks, look for hidden sources of caffeine such as chocolate, cough and cold medicine, and other over-the-counter medicine. Alcohol consumption can result in nighttime wakefulness. Cut back on sugar. Although sugar can give a burst of energy, it's short-lived and can cause uneven blood sugar levels. This can disrupt sleep 18 in the middle of the night as blood sugar levels fall."
